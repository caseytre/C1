        <h2>Discussion Post 01: Student Introductions & The Purpose of a Personal Site</h2>
        <article>
          Hi everyone, I’m Casey. I should start off by saying that the past 3 years, I’ve been working towards my biology degree on a premed track. As of today, I am no longer a biology major! After getting my hands dirty in healthcare, I realized I needed something different. It was an extremely difficult decision and a rather complex one too; I spent this entire year trying to figure it out. All of that to say, I’m excited to be here on this new path!
I enjoy staying active and keeping up with my friends. I love traveling and going on hikes. But my hobbies consist of staying busy online. I continuously think of new ideas that I can try, and hyperfixate on them until they get done. I like to think of it as like, if I haven’t been on my laptop for hours a day, then it was not a productive day. Which is exactly why I need my hikes to remind myself to go outside! If we were in a classroom, I don’t know how, but I’d have to bring a tree (grass works too). This is a photo of my most recent travel to Colorado; nature is absolutely beautiful. Something interesting about myself is that I skydived last year!

        <h2>Discussion Post 02: Deconstructing Web Design</h2>
        <article>
          I used the UltaLinks to an external site. for my example of inspecting a website. I always admired the color scheme and font because it's so clean and pleasing to look at. To not make this discussion post too complicated, I focused on the search box of the website to describe it's padding, border, and margins. It was cool to see the box being used in such a simple way, the search box kept it's size at 507x22px. I even got to change it a bit and see how it looked when I made it wider.
          Furthermore, Ulta uses a Flexbox layout so it was cool to see the things we've learned be used to create great imagery. The font variants, colors for the bottom of margins and or sides, and color schemes at play. I know this wasn't part of the discussion post, but I found how to highlight the Grid/Masonry overlays along with the Flexbox overlays. It's really cool to see how a bunch of boxes can be so malleable yet structured at the same time. I liked the Ulta website because it was so simple, though seeing what's truly outside of the boxes (pun intended)- it's not that simple at all. They all come together to form a visually pleasing website.

        <h2>Discussion Post 03: The Living Web</h2>
        <article>
          After weeks of hand-building my website, I view Laurel Schwulst’s “My website is a shifting house…" a lot differently. The first time I read it, I thought it was just artsy and poetic. Now, I can see she was literally describing the process. My site has genuinely shifted over time, from new layouts, new pages, new ideas, and a long list of tiny fixes that slowly make it feel more like me. I finally get what she means when she talks about a website being alive, personal, and always changing. When I push updates live, it feels less like posting into chaos and more like adding another piece of furniture to a home that already exists on the internet. Social platforms make you squeeze into a template. A personal site lets you actually control the vibe and story on your own terms, which I appreciate so much more now.
          For Project 02, my professional portfolio will be my digital diary for anything career-related. It’ll show my projects, my interests, and the odd combo of things I'm interested in. It’s not just a portfolio. It’s proof of consistency, growth, and identity in the open web, built page by page.
