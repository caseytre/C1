            This is my curated collection of things that I love. Each item here represents something meaningful to me,
            because I took these pictures.
            I love traveling and hiking so I chose my top 6 items to share with you.

                    I really enjoy this picture because I took it with my mom.
                    Recently I moved so I haven't spent as much time with my family.
                    But by the end of this trip, I was ready to have my own space again!

                    One of the most prettiest skylines I've seen.
                    Almost as pretty as the San Antonio riverwalk (not). Can't wait to go back!

                <p class="description">
                    There was a small time in my life where I was supposed to move and live in Hawaii.
                    Decided it wasn't really for me and moved back home last minute. Everyone asked why?
                    I always said because Hawaii is beautiful for vacation but not for building a life.

                <p class="description">
                    This is my cat, Remington. He is very special to me because he doesn't behave like a regular cat.
                    He doesn't meow a lot and he hates fish and salmon. But, he's still a cat!

                    I love this picture because in my opinion I think the red and blue color contrast is striking.
                    This is a nonedited photo. Nature never fails to amaze me.

                <p class="description">
                    This is one of the things I painted this year. I've always thought of myself
                    to lack the skills of painting then I found a style that I really enjoyed. Now,
                    it's not half-bad to look at.
